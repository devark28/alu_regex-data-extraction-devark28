# Regex Script Assignment

The JS script uses regex to extract data passed to the script as a parameter (inspired by previous assignments)
then extracts the matches, formats, and outputs them into a JSON readable format with proper indentations for readability

```bash
./extractor.js data.txt > information.json;
./extractor.js data_2.txt > information_2.json;
```

The above 2 bash commands were used to redirect the output of that executable extractor JS script to the output files.
